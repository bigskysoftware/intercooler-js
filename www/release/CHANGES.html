  <h3>Intercooler 0.9.0 - TBD</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reworked history to use remote restoration once local storage overflows.
    </li>
    <li>
      <code>ic-indicator</code> class will now work on next sibling of element firing request
    </li>
    <li>
      Partial response selector now pulls content from <strong>within</strong> the selected element,
      rather than the entire element.
    </li>
    <li>
      All non-GET requests are issued as POSTs now.  This is because browsers have funky, browser dependent
      rules on how they handle redirects with parameters to a GET: sometimes they pass them along, sometimes
      they don't.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Intercooler 0.4.10 - April 17th, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reworked history storage to be more stable and less leaky.
    </li>
    <li>
      Bug fixes
    </li>
  </ul>

  <a class="anchor" id="0_4_9"></a>
  <h3>Intercooler 0.4.9 - March 10th, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Added the <code>ic-select-from-response</code> attribute, allowing people to select sub-elements from a
      server response to swap in.
    </li>
    <li>
      Extended the <code>ic-include</code> attribute to allow for JSON name/value pairs to be included in a
      request.
    </li>
    <li>
      Default the value of <code>ic-always-update</code> to true, so you have to opt out of content swapping now.
    </li>
    <li>
      Added the <code>ic-remove-after</code> attribute, allowing people to remove an element after a given
      interval of time cleanly.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <a class="anchor" id="0_4_8"></a>
  <h3>Intercooler 0.4.8 - January 27th, 2015</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reworked history support, with the <code>ic-push-url</code> attribute.  Renamed the <code>X-IC-SetLocation</code>
      response header to <code>X-IC-PushURL</code> to be consistent with the new attribute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Include the current URL on all intercooler requests in the <code>ic-current-url</code> parameter.
    </li>
    <li>
      For elements with no text children, apply the fadeFast transition to children only, rather than the parent.  This
      makes buttons look better if their content is wrapped in a span.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Intercooler 0.4.6 - December 30th, 2014</h3>

  <h4>Comments on 0.4.0 Release</h4>

  <p>
    The big enhancement in this release (small code change, but <strong>big</strong> functionality boost!) is the <code>X-IC-Trigger</code>
    response header, which finally solves a tricky problem I've been wrestling with: How do you communicate server side state
    changes that have client-side UI ramifications that fall outside the usual Intercooler request-and-replace
    partial view flow?
  </p>

  <p>This new mechanism allows you to cleanly separate your server side and client-side logic even in cases where the
    simple content-swapping approach isn't enough.</p>

  <p>A great example is if you want to hide a modal if and only if a form in the modal submits valid data to the
    server.  You can now easily fire an <code>server.accountCreated</code> event (as an example) from the server side
    and respond to that on the client side by hiding the modal.  Clean, crisp and very little code!</p>

  <p>You can download the latest <code>intercooler.js</code> from <a href="/download.html">the Downloads page</a>.</p>

  <p>Enjoy!</p>
