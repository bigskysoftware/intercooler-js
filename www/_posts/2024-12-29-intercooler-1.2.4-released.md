I have released intercooler v1.2.4, available on the main site, as well as through bower and NPM.

  <http://intercoolerjs.org/download.html>

Changes in this release are:

* A bug in SSE support that allowed multiple listeners for the same even was fixed
* Chained property access in the `ic-action` attribute is now supported
* Multiple query parameters with the same name are now supported for local anchors

Enjoy, and thanks for using intercooler!
